class Constant: ...


POINTS: Constant
'''
Each vertex represents a point
'''

LINES: Constant
'''
Vertices 0 and 1 are considered a line. Vertices 2 and 3 are considered a line.
And so on. If the user specifies a non-even number of vertices, then the extra vertex is ignored.
'''

LINE_LOOP: Constant
'''
As line strips, except that the first and last vertices are also used as a line.
Thus, you get n lines for n input vertices. If the user only specifies 1 vertex,
the drawing command is ignored. The line between the first and last vertices happens
after all of the previous lines in the sequence.
'''

LINE_STRIP: Constant
'''
The adjacent vertices are considered lines. Thus, if you pass n vertices, you will get n-1 lines.
If the user only specifies 1 vertex, the drawing command is ignored.
'''

TRIANGLES: Constant
'''
Vertices 0, 1, and 2 form a triangle. Vertices 3, 4, and 5 form a triangle. And so on.
'''

TRIANGLE_STRIP: Constant
'''
Every group of 3 adjacent vertices forms a triangle. The face direction of the
strip is determined by the winding of the first triangle. Each successive triangle
will have its effective face order reversed, so the system compensates for that
by testing it in the opposite way. A vertex stream of n length will generate n-2 triangles.
'''

TRIANGLE_FAN: Constant
'''
The first vertex is always held fixed. From there on, every group of 2 adjacent
vertices form a triangle with the first. So with a vertex stream, you get a list
of triangles like so: (0, 1, 2) (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 4), etc. A vertex stream of
n length will generate n-2 triangles.
'''

LINES_ADJACENCY: Constant
'''
These are special primitives that are expected to be used specifically with
geomtry shaders. These primitives give the geometry shader more vertices
to work with for each input primitive. Data needs to be duplicated in buffers.
'''

PATCHES: Constant
'''
primitive type can only be used when Tessellation is active. It is a primitive
with a user-defined number of vertices, which is then tessellated based on the
control and evaluation shaders into regular points, lines, or triangles, depending
on the TES's settings.
'''

NEAREST: Constant
'''
Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest
(in Manhattan distance) to the specified texture coordinates.
'''

LINEAR: Constant
'''
Returns the weighted average of the four texture elements
that are closest to the specified texture coordinates.
These can include items wrapped or repeated from other parts
of a texture, depending on the values of texture repeat mode,
and on the exact mapping.
'''

NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST: Constant
'''
Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the
pixel being textured and uses the ``NEAREST``` criterion (the texture
element closest to the specified texture coordinates) to produce
a texture value.
'''

LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST: Constant
'''
Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the pixel
being textured and uses the ``LINEAR`` criterion (a weighted average
of the four texture elements that are closest to the specified
texture coordinates) to produce a texture value.
'''

NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR: Constant
'''
Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the
pixel being textured and uses the ``NEAREST`` criterion (the texture
element closest to the specified texture coordinates ) to produce
a texture value from each mipmap. The final texture value is a
weighted average of those two values.
'''

LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR: Constant
'''
Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel
being textured and uses the ``LINEAR`` criterion (a weighted average
of the texture elements that are closest to the specified texture
coordinates) to produce a texture value from each mipmap.
The final texture value is a weighted average of those two values.
'''

NOTHING: Constant
'''Represents no states. Can be used with :py:meth:`Context.enable_only` to disable all states.'''

BLEND: Constant
'''Enable/disable blending'''

DEPTH_TEST: Constant
'''Enable/disable depth testing'''

CULL_FACE: Constant
'''Enable/disable face culling'''

RASTERIZER_DISCARD: Constant
'''Enable/disable rasterization'''

PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE: Constant
'''
Context flag: Enables ``gl_PointSize`` in vertex or geometry shaders.

When enabled we can write to ``gl_PointSize`` in the vertex shader to specify the point size
for each individual point.

If this value is not set in the shader the behavior is undefined. This means the points may
or may not appear depending if the drivers enforce some default value for ``gl_PointSize``.

When disabled :py:attr:`Context.point_size` is used.

        Since allocating storage is likely faster than the implicit synchronization,
        you gain significant performance advantages over synchronization.

        The old storage will still be used by the OpenGL commands that have been sent previously.
        It is likely that the GL driver will not be doing any allocation at all,

    '''

    polygon_offset: Tuple[float, float]
    '''
    tuple: Get or set the current polygon offset.

    The tuple values represents two float values: ``unit`` and a ``factor``::

        ctx.polygon_offset = unit, factor

    When drawing polygons, lines or points directly on top of
    exiting geometry the result is often not visually pleasant.
    We can experience z-fighting or partially fading fragments
    due to different primitives not being rasterized in the exact
    same way or simply depth buffer precision issues.

    For example when visualizing polygons drawing a wireframe
    version on top of the original mesh, these issues are
    immediately apparent. Applying decals to surfaces is
    another common example.

    The official documentation states the following::

        When enabled, the depth value of each fragment is added
        to a calculated offset value. The offset is added before
        the depth test is performed and before the depth value
        is written into the depth buffer. The offset value o is calculated by:
        o = m * factor + r * units
        where m is the maximum depth slope of the polygon and r is the smallest
        value guaranteed to produce a resolvable difference in window coordinate
        depth values. The value r is an implementation-specific constant.

    In simpler terms: We use polygon offset to either add a positive offset to
    the geometry (push it away from you) or a negative offset to geometry
    (pull it towards you).

    * ``units`` is a constant offset to depth and will do the job alone
        if we are working with geometry parallel to the near/far plane.
    * The ``factor`` helps you handle sloped geometry (not parallel to near/far plane).

    In most cases you can get away with ``[-1.0, 1.0]`` for both factor and units,
    but definitely play around with the values. When both values are set to ``0``
    polygon offset is disabled internally.

    To just get started with something you can try::

        # Either push the geomtry away or pull it towards you
        # with support for handling small to medium sloped geometry
        ctx.polygon_offset = 1.0, 1.0
        ctx.polygon_offset = -1.0, -1.0

        # Disable polygon offset
        ctx.polygon_offset = 0, 0
    '''

    viewport: Tuple[int, int, int, int]

        >>> ctx.viewport = (0, 0, 640, 360)
        >>> ctx.viewport

    tuple: Get or set the scissor box for the active framebuffer.

    When scissor testing is enabled fragments outside

    applies to rendered geometry or :py:meth:`Context.clear`.

    Setting is value enables scissor testing in the framebuffer.
    Setting the scissor to ``None`` disables scissor testing
    and reverts the scissor box to match the framebuffer size.

    Example::

        # Enable scissor testing
        >>> ctx.scissor = 100, 100, 200, 100
        # Disable scissor testing
        >>> ctx.scissor = None

    A Sampler Object is an OpenGL Object that stores the sampling parameters for a Texture access inside of a shader.

    When a sampler object is bound to a texture image unit,
    the internal sampling parameters for a texture bound to the same image unit are all ignored.
    Instead, the sampling parameters are taken from this sampler object.

    Unlike textures, a samplers state can also be changed freely be at any time
    without the sampler object being bound/in use.

    Samplers are bound to a texture unit and not a texture itself. Be careful with leaving
    samplers bound to texture units as it can cause texture incompleteness issues
    (the texture bind is ignored).

    Sampler bindings do clear automatically between every frame so a texture unit
    need at least one bind/use per frame.
    '''

    repeat_x: bool
    '''
    bool: The x repeat flag for the sampler (Default ``True``).

    Example::

    '''

    compare_func: str
    '''
    tuple: The compare function for a depth textures (Default ``'?'``).

    By default samplers don't have depth comparison mode enabled.
    This means that depth texture values can be read as a ``sampler2D``
    using ``texture()`` in a GLSL shader by default.

    When setting this property to a valid compare mode, ``GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE``
    is set to ``GL_COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE`` so that texture lookup
    functions in GLSL will return a depth comparison result instead
    of the actual depth value.

    Accepted compare functions::

        .compare_func = ''    # Disale depth comparison completely
        sampler.compare_func = '<='  # GL_LEQUAL
        sampler.compare_func = '<'   # GL_LESS

    anisotropy: float
    '''
    float: Number of samples for anisotropic filtering (Default ``1.0``).

    The value will be clamped in range ``1.0`` and ``ctx.max_anisotropy``.

    Any value greater than 1.0 counts as a use of anisotropic filtering::

        # Disable anisotropic filtering
        sampler.anisotropy = 1.0

        # Enable anisotropic filtering suggesting 16 samples as a maximum

    tuple: The (r, g, b, a) color for the texture border (Default ``(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)``).

    When setting this value the ``repeat_`` values are overridden setting the texture wrap to return
    the border color when outside [0, 1] range.

    Example::

        # Red border color
        sampler.border_color = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

        Bind a texture to an image unit (OpenGL 4.2 required).

        This is used to bind textures to image units for shaders.
        The idea with image load/store is that the user can bind
        one of the images in a Texture to a number of image binding points
        (which are separate from texture image units). Shaders can read
        information from these images and write information to them,
        in ways that they cannot with textures.

        It's important to specify the right access type for the image.
        This can be set with the ``read`` and ``write`` arguments.
        Allowed combinations are:

        - **Read-only**: ``read=True`` and ``write=False``
        - **Write-only**: ``read=False`` and ``write=True``
        - **Read-write**: ``read=True`` and ``write=True``

        ``format`` specifies the format that is to be used when performing
        formatted stores into the image from shaders. ``format`` must be
        compatible with the texture's internal format. **By default the format
        of the texture is passed in. The format parameter is only needed
        when overriding this behavior.**

        Note that we bind the 3D textured layered making the entire texture
        readable and writable. It is possible to bind a specific 2D section
        in the future.

        one of the images in a Texture to a number of image binding points

        '''
        Bind a texture to an image unit (OpenGL 4.2 required).

        This is used to bind textures to image units for shaders.
        The idea with image load/store is that the user can bind
        one of the images in a Texture to a number of image binding points
        (which are separate from texture image units). Shaders can read
        information from these images and write information to them,
        in ways that they cannot with textures.

        It's important to specify the right access type for the image.
        This can be set with the ``read`` and ``write`` arguments.
        Allowed combinations are:

        - **Read-only**: ``read=True`` and ``write=False``
        - **Write-only**: ``read=False`` and ``write=True``
        - **Read-write**: ``read=True`` and ``write=True``

        ``format`` specifies the format that is to be used when performing
        formatted stores into the image from shaders. ``format`` must be
        compatible with the texture's internal format. **By default the format
        of the texture is passed in. The format parameter is only needed
        when overriding this behavior.**
